 * The view contract (wave 3, C3-1): what the frame (S-08, P4) gives each tab's
 * view, and what it calls on it. Fixed before the tracks start, so S-05…S-08

 *
 * Types only, and in P2 rather than P3: a view track's folder
 * (`views/http/`…) may import only its own directory and the P2 barrel
 * (`lint:layers` rule 4), so this is the one place every track can reach.
 * The frame gets them through the P3 barrel, which re-exports P2.
